# Hardware longevity tests

## All devices

- [ ] Can last for at least 10 years with constant heavy usage (avg: 24 hours per day with 100% CPU usage) and can last for 50 or more years with total usage

- [ ] Planned obsolescence is forbidden, the computer cannot be made obsolete through the methods of planned obsolescence

- [ ] If a keyboard is included, it MUST be mechanical and durable, and must be able to handle at least 368,000,000,000 (368 trillion) keystrokes per key

- [ ] All system parts must be easily replaceable, and you must give your hardware owners/users the right to repair

- [ ] Features from day 1 cannot be taken away for voiding the warranty, or for any reason

> No special screws or parts, no refusal or resistance to have a 3rd party repair the device, no soldering to the point of no repair.

- [ ] The user must be able to choose what operating system they can install, and can't be locked into a set of 1 to 5000 operating systems, they must be able to install ANY operating system they want (that is compatible with a 64 bit/128 bit processor and the hardware specs given) even if it were to cause low or undesired performance

- [ ] Battery is easily replaceable

- [ ] The touch screen must be durable, and must be able to withstand at least 6,400,000,000,000,000 (6.4 quintillion) presses on any portion

- [ ] A Terms of Service CANNOT be used to force the usage of 1 operating system or another, and 1 software/software component or another

All rules are immune to any government law and succeed all laws other than this law.

## Laptops

Referring to any portable computer with a portable power source. This includes Laptops, Notebooks, Netbooks, iBooks, etc.

- [ ] There must be a set of normal USB ports, there can't be only a port that requires a dongle

- [ ] The lid must be durable

> Remember: Power and durability > Low weight

## Cell phones

This also includes smart phones, flip phones, foldable phones, and any other phone that can send/receive phone calls

- [ ] The SIM card must be easily removable, and can't fault to "No SIM card detected" due to a refusal to check if one is inserted

## Desktop computers

- [ ] There must be a set of normal USB ports, there can't be only a port that requires a dongle

- [ ] The user MUST be able to connect their own hardware to the desktop, under all circumstances, no matter what. This includes keyboards, mice, trackpads, headphones, earphones, external storage devices, and more

## Consoles and screens

Refers to video game consoles and screen displays

- [ ] Consoles cannot be restricted to their own games, and MUST accept games from other consoles in the current generation, no matter what

- [ ] Displays must be environmentally friendly, and use non-emissive technologies, such as LED lights

## Headphones and earphones

- [ ] The pairing button must be separate from the power button, the 2 buttons CANNOT be merged

- [ ] The device must be able to communicate with any device in an open source fashion, and tell it things such as battery health, battery life, volume level, etc.

## Other notes

**Note:** some of these rules were created from my own personal experience

These rules may seem hard to follow, but they were written in a complex way to avoid companies and people using loopholes to break the rules. The rules are actually very simple.
